**# Producer-Consumer Project**

**## Overview**
This project simulates the Producer-Consumer problem with synchronization mechanisms in a multi-threaded environment.

**## Features**
- Multi-threaded producer and consumer processes.
- Fixed-size buffer queue.
- Command-line parameters to control thread behavior.

**## Building the Project**
Use `make` to compile the source files into an executable.

**## Running the Application**
Run the compiled executable with the required arguments to start the producer and consumer threads.

**## Usage**
Commands within the application to produce and consume items in the buffer.

**## Output**
Logs and console output that reflect the producer-consumer activity and system state.

**## Implementation**
Details of the synchronization techniques used (semaphores, mutexes, etc.).

**## Contributing**
Guidelines for contributing to the project, if applicable.
